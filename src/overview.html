        <p>The electronic log book client API allows programmers to easily add 
            the ability for their programs to make log entries.</p>
        <div class="overview">
            <h1>Electronic Log Book Client API Overview</h1>        
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>In order to use the library you need to include it in the classpath
                of your Java program.  The most recent version of the library is
                available from accelerator and CUE Linux machines at 
                <em>/apps/eloglib/jlog.jar</em>.  You need to have a client 
                certificate to make direct submissions to the server.  JLab users
                can obtain a certificate from the server at the following URL:</p>
            <a href="https://logbooks.jlab.org/cert">
                https://logbooks.jlab.org/cert</a>
            <p>You need to save the PEM formatted certificate as <em>.elogcert</em>
                in your home directory.  If you install the certificate in your 
                certificate store you can verify the server accepts it by navigating to:
            </p>
            <a href="https://logbooks.jlab.org/authtest/">
                https://logbooks.jlab.org/authtest/</a>
            <p><b>Note: </b>system administrators may have generated your 
                certificate and placed it in your home directory for you already.
            </p>

             revision.setEmailNotify(<span class="character">&quot;</span><span class="character">ryans@jlab.org</span><span class="character">&quot;</span>);
             revision.submit();
             
             System.<span class="ST3">out</span>.println(<span class="character">&quot;</span><span class="character">Done with submission, comment, and revision.</span><span class="character">&quot;</span>);

            <p>The example program is included with the <a href="#source">source</a> code and can be run 
                on an accelerator Linux machine with the following commands:</p>
            <pre><kbd>
cd jlog
javac -cp /apps/eloglib/jlog.jar  test/org/jlab/elog/example/BasicDemo.java
java -cp /apps/eloglib/jlog.jar:test org.jlab.elog.example.BasicDemo 
        </kbd></pre>
            <p>Running the example on Windows is similar, but the classpath (-cp) 
                delimiter is a semicolon instead of a colon.  The path to the 
                library is likely unavailable on Windows so a copy of the library
                may need to be made.</p>
            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>A Java properties file is located in the package 
                <em>org.jlab.elog</em> and is named <em>elog.properties</em>. This
                file contains the default properties.  You can use the 
                <code>Library.setConfiguration</code> method to override the 
                properties.
                The properties include:</p>
            <dl class="property-list">
                <dt>LOG_ENTRY_SCHEMA_URL</dt>
                <dd>The URL to the log entry schema.</dd>
                <dt>COMMENT_SCHEMA_URL</dt>
                <dd>The URL to the comment schema.</dd>
                <dt>SUBMIT_URL</dt>
                <dd>The URL to submit (HTTP PUT) entries and comments to the log 
                    book server.</dd>
                <dt>FETCH_URL</dt>
                <dd>The URL to fetch (HTTP GET) log entries and comments.</dd>
                <dt>QUEUE_PATH</dt>
                <dd>The path on the local workstation (usually a network file share) 
                    to drop (queue) log entries and comments.  If this property is
                    missing or empty then the library will attempt to detect whether
                    the program is running on Windows or UNIX and use the default 
                    value for the OS type, as defined in DEFAULT_UNIX_QUEUE_PATH and 
                    DEFAULT_WINDOWS_QUEUE_PATH.</dd>
                <dt>DEFAULT_UNIX_QUEUE_PATH</dt>
                <dd>The default file path to queue files if the QUEUE_PATH property
                    is undefined and the library determines that it is running on a 
                    UNIX system.</dd>            
                <dt>DEFAULT_WINDOWS_QUEUE_PATH</dt>
                <dd>The default file path to queue files if the QUEUE_PATH property
                    is undefined and the library determines that it is running on a 
                    WINDOWS system.</dd>   
                <dt>ATTACH_SINGLE_MAX_BYTES</dt>
                <dd>Maximum number of bytes allowed in a single attachment file.</dd>
                <dt>ATTACH_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES</dt>
                <dd>Maximum number of bytes allowed across all attachments.</dd>            
            </dl>
            <p>If building from source then you can edit the properties file before
                running the build.  If you already have a compiled library in a jar file
                then you can modify the properties file that is included inside the jar.  
                On Windows a program such as 7-Zip can be used to edit the file in place.
                Alternatively you can extract the files in the jar, modify the properties,
                (with vi for example), then combine the files back into a jar using the 
                following commands:</p>
            <pre><kbd>
jar xf jlog.jar
vi org/jlab/elog/elog.properties
jar cf jlog.jar org META-INF
        </kbd></pre> 
            <b>Attachment Size Limits</b>
            <p>
                Client-side size limits on attachments are enforced to help avoid an
                OutOfMemoryError or rejection by the server due to crossing the server
                attachment limit.  The checks are performed when the addAttachment
                method is called or when creating a LogEntry from an XML file.
            </p>
            <p>
                These limits are much lower than the limits if using the C++ implementation.
                The reason is because the default maximum heap size in Java is often 64MB.
                If you increase the limits here then be sure to bump up your JVM limit as 
                well.  For example, the command to execute Java with a max heap of 512 MB is:
                "java -Xmx512m".
            </p>
            <p>
                The server may send a LogEntry or Comment back to the client which
                references attachments (via URLs) which are larger than these limits.  The 
                library will download all of the attachments to verify they
                are within the client limits.

            </p>

            <p>The Java electronic log book client API is named <em>jlog</em> and is
                stored in the git repository on devl00.  It can be
                accessed by members of the JLab accelerator group <em>epics</em> 
                from an accelerator Linux machine with the command:</p>
            <pre><kbd>
git init jlog
cd jlog
git pull ssh://devl00/usr/devsite/git/jlog.git 
        </kbd></pre>
            <p>An Apache Ant build file (build.xml) is used to compile and package 
                the library.</p>
