        <p>The electronic log book client API allows programmers to easily add 
            the ability for their programs to make log entries.</p>

            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
                In order to use the library you need to include it in the 
                classpath of your Java program.  The software is packaged with
                Maven and available from <a href="https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jlog">https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jlog</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to have a client 
                certificate to make direct submissions to the server.  JLab users
                can obtain a certificate from the server at the following URL:
            <a href="https://logbooks.jlab.org/cert">
                https://logbooks.jlab.org/cert</a>
            </p>
            <p>You need to save the PEM formatted certificate as <em>.elogcert</em>
                in your home directory (or else be prepared to explicitly instruct the library where you saved the file if not in the default location).  If you install the
                certificate in the certificate store used by your web browser you can verify the logbook server accepts it by navigating to:

            <a href="https://logbooks.jlab.org/authtest/">
                https://logbooks.jlab.org/authtest/</a>
            </p>
            <p><b>Note: </b>JLab staff on JLab computers may have a
                certificate already in your home directory placed there by a system administrator for you.
            </p>
            <b>Example Program 1: Hello World</b>
            <pre><code>

         <span class="keyword-directive">long</span> lognumber = entry.submitNow();

         System.<span class="ST3">out</span>.println(<span class="character">&quot;</span><span class="character">Successfully submitted log entry number: </span><span class="character">&quot;</span> + lognumber);
     }

            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                A Java properties file is used to set configuration.   A default file is included inside the jar.
                To override defaults create a file named <em>jlog.properties</em> in your home directory with
                desired overrides.  Alternatively you can use the
                <code>Library.setConfiguration</code> method to override the 
                properties.  The properties include:
            </p>
            <dl class="property-list">
                <dt><b>LOG_ENTRY_SCHEMA_URL</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The URL to the log entry schema.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>COMMENT_SCHEMA_URL</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The URL to the comment schema.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>SUBMIT_URL</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The URL to submit (HTTP PUT) entries and comments to the log 
                    book server.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>FETCH_URL</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The URL to fetch (HTTP GET) log entries and comments.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>QUEUE_PATH</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The path on the local workstation (usually a network file 
                    share) to drop (queue) log entries and comments.  If this
                    property is missing or empty then the library will attempt 
                    to detect whether the program is running on Windows or UNIX 
                    and use the default value for the OS type, as defined in 
                    DEFAULT_UNIX_QUEUE_PATH and DEFAULT_WINDOWS_QUEUE_PATH.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>DEFAULT_UNIX_QUEUE_PATH</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The default file path to queue files if the QUEUE_PATH 
                    property is undefined and the library determines that it is 
                    running on a UNIX system.
                </dd>            
                <dt><b>DEFAULT_WINDOWS_QUEUE_PATH</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The default file path to queue files if the QUEUE_PATH 
                    property is undefined and the library determines that it is 
                    running on a WINDOWS system.
                </dd>   
                <dt><b>ATTACH_SINGLE_MAX_BYTES</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Maximum number of bytes allowed in a single attachment file.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>ATTACH_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Maximum number of bytes allowed across all attachments.
                </dd>   
                <dt><b>IGNORE_SERVER_CERT_ERRORS</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    For testing it is often useful to ignore self signed 
                    certificates such as those used on logbooktest.acc.jlab.org.
                </dd>                 
            </dl>
            <p>
            <b>Attachment Size Limits</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Client-side size limits on attachments are enforced to help 
                avoid an OutOfMemoryError or rejection by the server due to 
                crossing the server attachment limit.  The checks are performed
                when the addAttachment method is called or when creating a 
                LogEntry from an XML file.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default these limits are much lower than the limits if using
                the C++ implementation.  The reason is because the default 
                maximum heap size in Java is often 64MB.  If you increase the
                limits here then be sure to bump up your JVM limit as well.  
                For example, the command to execute Java with a max heap of 
                512 MB is: "java -Xmx512m".
            </p>
            <p>
                The server may send a LogEntry or Comment back to the client 
                which references attachments (via URLs) which are larger than
                these limits.  The library will download all of the attachments 
                to verify they are within the client limits.
