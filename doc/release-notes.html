        <h1>Java eloglib Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>September 27, 2018 - Version 3.1.0</h2>
        <p>Default properties updated now that server requires SSL for schema.  Server certificate checking is now a configurable option.</p>          
        <h2>November 28, 2017 - Version 3.0.0</h2>
        <p>Upgraded to Java 7 platform (no longer support Java 6) - this fixed many issues related to Java 6 JVM.</p>        
        <h2>September 16, 2014 - Version 2.9</h2>
        <p>Added support for problem reports: a tool for operations to record issues they 
            encounter in the elog. A log entry now has an optional problem report section.</p>
        <h2>March 15, 2013 - Version 2.8</h2>
        <p>This version fixes a bug in the Java elog Client API. When writing out the 
            XML either to a file for queuing or to an HTTP server via PUT, the Java IO stream 
            constructors assume platform character encoding. The character encoding is now 
            always UTF-8 as intended.</p>
        <h2>March 14, 2013 - Version 2.7</h2>
        <p>This version adds a new &quot;addAttachment&quot; overloaded method which allows 
            specification of a caption, but with auto-detection of mime-type. This is needed 
            for the elog command line interface project. </p>
        <h2>March 12, 2013 - Version 2.6</h2>
        <p>Added a new method named submitNow that takes an argument specifying a path 
            to a certificate file. There was already a method named SubmitNow, but it doesn't 
            take any arguments and just uses the default certificate path. I've also added 
            an additional example program named HelloWorldDemo and updated the docs to reflect 
            this. The reason for these two changes is someone from offsite is about to use 
            the API and we noticed there were deficiencies with the offsite scenario mostly 
            due to the fact that there is not going to be a queue directory available. The 
            example program we had originally is not good for offsite people because if 
            they don't setup their certificate correctly or invert the arguments to the 
            LogEntry constructor the exception generated is masked by the queue directory 
            not found exception until they code some try catches with whyQueued or switch 
            to the submitNow method. The HelloWorldDemo just uses submitNow and is good 
            for offsite users. </p>
        <h2>January 15, 2013 - Version 2.5</h2>
        <p>Fixed bug where accessing attachments from an existing XML file would fail 
            if the existing XML had spaces around the attachment tag. (Added check to DOM 
            traversal code to ensure node was an instance of Element instead of TextNode).</p>
        <h2>January 2, 2013 - Version 2.4</h2>
        <p>Updated default UNIX queue path configuration parameter in the elog.properties 
            file from &quot;/u/group/elogbooks/logentryq/new&quot; to &quot;/group/elogbooks/logentryq/new&quot;.</p>
        <h2>October 12, 2012 - Version 2.3</h2>
        <p>This is the initial public release of the Java implementation of the Electronic 
            Logbooks API.</p>
